                <h3>Why is Color Important?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adequate color control ensures that content is understand and accessible for all individuals with visual impairments like color blindness or low vision, as well as improving readability for everyone</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Color Standards ensures legal compliance for sites that have government ties as well, preventing exclusionary design</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Forgetting about how good color constrast meets accessibility standards, legible color constrast improves the users quality of life, minimizing eye strain and overall usability/readibility</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <ul id="examples">
                    <li id="example1">Black on White will have the highest contrast ratio of 21:1, but whats the worst look like?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li id="example2">While Yellow and White on have the worst at 1.07:1, not so easy to read right? </li>
                    <br>
                    <li id="example3">According to WCAG Success Criterion, the minimum allowed contrast ratio should be 4.5:1, heres an example of it </li>
                    <br>
                    <li id="example4">In terms of legibility, color isn't the only factor, some contrasts can be forgiven if larger text is included as well, considering this 3:1 contrast, not too bad to read right?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li id="example5">Versus this much higher constrast, but smaller text, even if they color is legible, isn't quite easy to make out what its saying</li>
                </ul>
