                    <li>Universal Design has been and will always be a growing branch of development. It promotes inclusivity, accesibility and usability for such a wide range of users</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Keeping up with Universal Design allows for not only a fully functional webpage, but an easily accessible page for all types of people whether they may be held back by disabilities</li>
